This is the source code of MSSA-TN proposed in the manuscript.

Requirement:
Matlab version  >=2018b. 
Python  version >=3.7.6, 
Tensorflow version >=2.1.0 
Tensornetwork version >=0.2.1

Part of data are packaged to test the algorithm
Test data and extracted muti-dimensional features have been put in /data/
Please first run /MSSA/MSSA.m to get the effect of MSSA and multi-dimensional features for tensor network classification
Then run /TN/TN.py to see the full result of MSSA-TN

Running classification results:
No adaptation: 0.5
MSSA: 0.57
MSSA-TN: 0.6351
